- 🧉Hi, I’m Luis a Controls Engineer @ Renasci Systems Integration Group.
     I graduated from NC State University with a B.S. and M.S in Mechanical Engineering, specialized in Dynamics &      Controls.

  - 🦾 As an undergraduate and Master student I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Gregory Bucker](https://mae.ncsu.edu/people/gbuckner/) 
  where I worked on multiple projects including:
     1. Designed and manufactured a 3DOF Gimbal system to test the fly dynamics of a rolling-flying vehicle (Undergrad)
     2. Designed and manufactured a spherical carbon fiber cage and a three-axis gimble system for a [rolling-flying vehicle](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/mechanismsrobotics/article/13/5/050901/1106903/The-Spherical-Rolling-Flying-Vehicle-Dynamic) (Undergrad)
     3. Developed a Neural-Netwrok based Model Reference Adaptive Control System for a Permanent Magnet Synchoronous [Spherical Motor](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1702/10/8/612). (Master's Project)


- 👀 I’m interested in robotics, computer vision, AI/ML development and deployment. I am currently working with [Dr. Lobaton](https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/ejlobato/) working on two publications, one a systematic review and another an AI model for detecting, segmentating and classifying microscopic images of nematodes


- 🌱 I’m currently learning about geopolitics, history and different cultures 🇸🇻
- 🏔️ I enjoy visiting National parks, playing soccer, playing card games, chess, hiking, and snowboarding 🏂
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can juggle a soccer ball for more than 30 minutes, Visca Barça ⚽️
