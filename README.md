I'm Luis a Visiting Reseacher in ECE @ NC State. I'm deeply interested in entrepreneurship, start-ups, and robotics. I've had the fortune to build my own consulting business, where I've worked on projects involving AI/ML development and deployment and automated robotic systems. 

As an undergraduate and master's student, I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Gregory Bucker](https://mae.ncsu.edu/people/gbuckner/) on multiple projects, including:  
1. Developed a ML-based Model Reference Adaptive Control System for a Permanent Magnet Synchronous [Spherical Motor](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1702/10/8/612). (Master's Project)
2. Designed and built a spherical carbon fiber cage and a three-axis gimble system for a [rolling-flying vehicle](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/mechanismsrobotics/article/13/5/050901/1106903/The-Spherical-Rolling-Flying-Vehicle-Dynamic) (Undergrad)
3. Designed and manufactured a 3DOF Gimbal system to test the flight dynamics of a rolling-flying vehicle (Undergrad)  


🦾 I’m passionate about human-robot collaboration to make agriculture more sustainable and accessible. I'm currently collaborating with [Dr. Edgar Lobaton](https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/ejlobato/), where I've contributed to a published journal paper and am preparing a conference submission.

1. [Machine Learning Techniques for Nematode Microscopic Image Analysis: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/2624-7402/7/11/356)
2. "An AI model for detecting, segmenting, and classifying microscopic images of parasitic nematodes"
     

Beyond research, I love learning about geopolitics, history, and different cultures and languages 🇸🇻. In my free time, I enjoy visiting National Parks, playing soccer, boxing, hiking, chess, and snowboarding 🏔️⚽️.

⚽️ Fun fact: I can keep a soccer ball in the air for more than 30 minutes — Visca Barça! 🇪🇸
